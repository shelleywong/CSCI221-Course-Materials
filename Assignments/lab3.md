# Lab 3: Binary Bomb (Part 1)

Defusing a Binary Bomb

## Introduction

The nefarious Dr. Evil has planted a slew of “binary bombs” on our class machines. A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequence of phases. Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin. If you type the correct string, then the phase is defused and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase has been defused.

There are too many bombs for us to deal with, so we are giving each student a bomb to defuse. Your mission, which you have no choice but to accept, is to defuse your bomb before the due date. Good luck, and welcome to the bomb squad!

### Logistics

This is an individual project. You will diffuse your own unique bomb. Clarifications and corrections will be posted in this Git repo or on Canvas.

## Step 1: Get Your Bomb
You can obtain your bomb by pointing your Web browser at:

[https://bomblab.dixon.phd/](https://bomblab.dixon.phd/)

This will display a binary bomb request form for you to fill in. Enter your *Chico State login ID* and *Campus Email* and hit the Submit button. Failing to use your campus username/email may result in your bomb not getting graded. The server will build your bomb and return it to your browser in a tar file called *bombk.tar*, where *k* is the unique number of your bomb.

Save the *bombk.tar* file to a (protected) directory on ecc-linux. To securely transfer files between a remote host (like ecc-linux) and your local computer, use the `scp` command or another option that supports SFTP (secure file transfer protocol).

Extract the files from the provided tar file:

```bash
  $ tar -xvf bombk.tar
```

This will create a directory called ./bombk with the following files:
  * README: Identifies the bomb and its owners.
  * bomb: The executable binary bomb.
  * bomb.c: Source file with the bomb’s main routine and a friendly greeting from Dr. Evil.

If for some reason you request multiple bombs, this is not a problem. Choose one bomb to work on and delete the rest.

## Step 2: Defuse Your Bomb

Your job for this lab is to defuse your bomb.

You **must** do the assignment on the ecc-linux.csuchico.edu server. In fact, there is a rumor that Dr. Evil really is evil, and the bomb will always blow up if run elsewhere. There are several other tamper-proofing devices built into the bomb as well, or so we hear.

You can use many tools to help you defuse your bomb. Please look at the hints section for some tips and ideas. The best way is to use your favorite debugger to step through the disassembled binary.

Each time your bomb explodes it notifies the bomblab server, and you lose 1/2 point (up to a max of 20 points) in the final score for the lab. So there are consequences to exploding the bomb. You must be careful!

For the Binary Bomb lab (Part 1), you must complete Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, each worth 10 points. Part 1 is worth a total of 30 points.

In the Binary Bomb lab (Part 2), you will complete 3 more phases. Part 2 is worth a total of 40 points (more details in the Lab 4 instructions).

Although phases get progressively harder to defuse, the expertise you gain as you move from phase to phase should offset this difficulty. However, the last phase will challenge even the best students, so please don’t wait until the last minute to start.

The bomb ignores blank input lines. If you run your bomb with a command line argument, for example,

```bash session
linux> ./bomb solution.txt
```

then it will read the input lines from solution.txt until it reaches EOF (end of file), and then switch over to stdin. In a moment of weakness, Dr. Evil added this feature so you don’t have to keep retyping the solutions to phases you have already defused.

To avoid accidentally detonating the bomb, you will need to learn how to single-step through the assembly code and how to set breakpoints. You will also need to learn how to inspect both the registers and the memory states. One of the nice side-effects of doing the lab is that you will get very good at using a debugger. This is a crucial skill that will pay big dividends the rest of your career.

## Logistics

This is an individual project. All hand-ins are electronic. Clarifications and corrections will be posted on the course message board.

## Submitting your Assignment

You should upload your solution text file, to INGInious as *solution.txt*. INGInious will have a place to provide the name/number of your bomb - this is to confirm which bomb I should use for assessment. The bomb will also notify me automatically about your progress as you work on it. For Part 1, I will only be checking your solutions for Phase 1, 2, and 3.

You can keep track of how you are doing by looking at the class scoreboard at:

[https://bomblab.dixon.phd/scoreboard](https://bomblab.dixon.phd/scoreboard)

This web page is updated continuously every 30 seconds to show the progress for each bomb. Let me know if it is down or doesn’t appear to be updating.

After Binary Bomb Part 1 is due, you will get 10 points for correctly answering in-class quiz questions about what is happening in some of the phases. Should you not solve them all you’ll only be responsible for answering questions related to the phases you pass. If you do not submit anything for the Binary Bomb Part 1 assignment, you will not receive credit for the in-class quiz.

## Hints (Please read this!)

There are many ways of defusing your bomb. You can examine it in great detail without ever running the program, and figure out exactly what it does. This is a useful technique, but it is not always easy to do. You can also run it under a debugger, watch what it does step by step, and use this information to defuse it. This is probably the fastest way of defusing it.

We do make one request, please do not use brute force! You could write a program that will try every possible key to find the right one. But this is no good for several reasons:

 * You lose 1/2 point (up to a max of 20 points) every time you guess incorrectly and the bomb explodes.
  * Every time you guess wrong, a message is sent to the bomblab server. You could very quickly saturate the network with these messages, and cause the system administrators to revoke your computer access.
  * We haven’t told you how long the strings are, nor have we told you what characters are in them. Even if you made the (incorrect) assumptions that they all are less than 80 characters long and only contain letters, then you will have 2680 guesses for each phase. This will take a very long time to run, and you will not get the answer before the assignment is due.


There are many tools which are designed to help you figure out both how programs work, and what is wrong when they don’t work. Here is a list of some of the tools you may find useful in analyzing your bomb, and hints on how to use them.
  * *gdb*
    * The GNU debugger, this is a command line debugger tool available on virtually every platform. You can trace through a program line by line, examine memory and registers, look at both the source code and assembly code (we are not giving you the source code for most of your bomb), set breakpoints, set memory watch points, and write scripts.
    * The CS:APP web site
    [http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/students.html](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/students.html)
    has a very handy *gdb* summary that you can print out and use as a reference (use the x86-64 Quick GDB reference).
    * Here are some other tips for using *gdb*.
        * To keep the bomb from blowing up every time you type in a wrong input, you’ll want to learn how to set breakpoints.
        * For online documentation, type `help` at the gdb command prompt, or type `man gdb`, or `info gdb` at a Unix prompt. Some people also like to run gdb under gdb-mode in emacs.
  * `objdump -t bomb`
    * This will print out the bomb’s symbol table. The symbol table includes the names of all functions and global variables in the bomb, the names of all the functions the bomb calls, and their addresses. You may learn something by looking at the function names!
  * `objdump -d bomb`
    * Use this to disassemble all of the code in the bomb. You can also just look at individual functions.
Reading the assembler code can tell you how the bomb works.
    * Although `objdump -d` gives you a lot of information, it doesn’t tell you the whole story. Calls to system-level functions are displayed in a cryptic form. For example, a call to sscanf might appear as:
        ```
        8048c36: e8 99 fc ff ff call 80488d4 <_init+0x1a0>
        //To determine that the call was to sscanf, you would need to disassemble within gdb.
        ```

  * `strings`
    * This utility will display the printable strings in your bomb.

  * `hostname`
    * The bomb requires that you use it on a restricted list of hostnames and I can't give it a wildcard. The lab will work on *ecc-linux*, so it is recommended that you work on ecc-linux. It should also work if you give your Linux machine or VM the hostname of ubuntu, but this has not been tested. If you get the following error, there is an issue with your hostname:
        ``` bash session
        $ ./bomb
        Initialization error: Running on an illegal host [2]
        ```

Looking for a particular tool? How about documentation? Don’t forget, the commands *apropos*, *man*, and *info* are your friends. In particular, *man ascii* might come in useful. *info gas* will give you more than you ever wanted to know about the GNU Assembler. Also, the web may also be a treasure trove of information. If you get stumped, feel free to ask your instructor for help.
